        <h3 class="faq-title">What is cyber security and its importance?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          Cybersecurity is the protection to defend internet-connected devices
          and services from malicious attacks by hackers, spammers, and
          cybercriminals. The practice is used by companies to protect against
          phishing schemes, ransomware attacks, identity theft, data breaches,
          and financial losses.

        <p class="faq-text">
          The benefits of data security include the prevention of data breaches,
          the protection of sensitive information, and the deterrence of
          cyber-attacks. Data security also helps to ensure the continuity of
          business operations in the event of a security breach or attack.

          Steps to take to protect against an attack and limit the damage if one
          occurs. Monitor your computers for unauthorized personnel access,
          devices (like USB drives), and software. Check your network for
          unauthorized users or connections. Investigate any unusual activities
          on your network or by your staff.

        <h3 class="faq-title">Is cyber security easy to learn?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          No, cybersecurity isn't hard. Although there may be difficult
          concepts, like cryptography or areas that require more technical
          knowledge, cybersecurity is one of the few fields in the tech world
          that doesn't require a strong technical background.

        <p class="faq-text">
          The 3 major types of cyber security are network security, cloud
          security, and physical security. Your operating systems and network
          architecture make up your network security. It can include network
          protocols, firewalls, wireless access points, hosts, and servers.
